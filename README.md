## Prerequisite:
-To run the BlackJack, make sure you have two accounts of MetaMask and installed on two browsers (for both dealer and player). We also need to add a local blockchain network for Ganache in MetaMask by entering RPC with http://127.0.0.1:8545 and Chain ID with 1337

-To deploy the contract, a Ganache needs to be opened.

## How to compile:
1. cd truffle 
2. truffle migrate --reset 
3. Open another terminal
4. cd BlacJack_frontend 
5. npm install 
6. npm start
7. Enter URL:http://localhost:3000/ in both browsers.
